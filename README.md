# ReverseADoublyLinkedList

## Description

Given the pointer to the head node of a doubly linked list, reverse the order of the nodes in place. That is, change the nodes' next and prev pointers so that the list's direction is reversed. Return a reference to the head node of the reversed list.

Note: The head node might be NULL to indicate an empty list.

## Returns

- DoublyLinkedListNode: a reference to the head of the reversed list

## Input

The first line contains an integer _t_, the number of test cases.

Each test case is of the following format:

- The first line contains an integer _n_, the number of elements in the linked list.
- The next _n_ lines contain an integer each denoting an element of the linked list.
